## Why did I make this API?

The idea for the website came from not knowing what to wear on a day that was humid and raining. I decided to create something that would allow users to do just that.
## License and Recognitions

In order help ensure fairness and sharing, I will be presenting all of the API's used in this code.

**Google Geocoding API**

- [Geocoding]() is used in this project to find the latitude and longtitude of a searched location. In order to use this API you must
sign up and get a key. Keys are free and have unlimited calls.

**OpenWeatherMap API**

- [OpenWeatherMap]() is used to get the weather information on a given location based on the latitude and longtitude. This API requires  key
which you can sign up for free with 60 calls a minute

**Instagram Web Scrapping**

- [Instagram]() has an API that I did not use. However I did use web scrapping to pictures of specific places. 

**Facebook Search Places**

- [Facebook]() has an API that I used and connected in a specific way that does not require client authentication every 4 hour. Check this out on the Instagram.py. Note this method only works with Python 3.6.2 or higher

**PixLab API**

- [PixLab]() is a Face detect API that is used to go through the list of instagram pictures and create a new list of images that contain faces.

**ThreadGenius API**

- [ThreadGenius]() is a recognition API that also has a free package install within Pycharm. This API is used to recognized clothing in a picture and returns a list of key words of the clothing.

**Pinterest Web Scrapping**

- [Pinterest]() has an API that I did not use because it does not have a search feature. Instead i as able to create urls and web scrap them with beautiful soup. Pinterest webscrapping url is created by the keywords from ThreadGenius. It returns the final list that is displayed
